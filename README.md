# database-management-project
The main aim of the project is to create a website where the customer can book freight from their home, request transit and check its status. They can even book different speed of transport.

The objective of our project is to improve as much as possible. Like there are many things which we are looking forward to do, like tracking a delivery, so this would be a great   feature in the app. Further our objective in the project is to make the customer and the user interact at a high level and just track the status of their goods.
